I needed a generic 9v battery case that would slide locked, and would would hold a larger plastic style cap.  This encloser is intended to be remixed / used in other projects so it is fairly simple  It prevents the battery from sliding around (even if using the slimmer flexible style 9v caps), and is an easy print for a locking style box on any style 3d printer.

In the spirit of Hacktoberfest, I wanted to put this one out here to allow others to remix however they see fit.

This case does not "assume" where holes for your wires should be, so instead of including pre-designed holes in the bottom or back, I left them out to make it it an easier remix for your projects.

This was built using FreeCAD, but the step files and stl files are also included.
